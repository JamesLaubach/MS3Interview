# MS3Interview

 
### Design -
After the feedback I was given, I made sure to use Maven and to use a more Object Oriented approach. There are only a few methods that are available to the user, with others that are private helper functions. In addition, all of the internal variables are private so that the user cannot manipulate them directly. I also made my comments more succinct and used the integrated git in eclipse to upload it to github. I also made more of an effort to handle exceptions better.
### How to start - 
I have been unable to create a working jar executable file due to my current ignorance with Maven. The main method is in App.java and CSVInterview.java contains all of the working code.
